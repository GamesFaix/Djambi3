## Rules

### The board
- The game is played on a 9x9 board with alternating black and white squares, like a chess board.
- The center square, called _The Maze_ is a different color and has some special properties.

### The players
- The game is designed for 4 players, but can be played with 2 or 3 players with some special considerations.
- Alliances or any form of diplomacy is allowed.
- The objective is to be the last player alive, so all alliances must be broken eventually.

### The pieces
- Each player has 9 pieces: 1 _Chief_, 1 _Assassin_, 1 _Reporter_, 1 _Diplomat_, 1 _Necromobile_, and 4 _Militants_. 
- All pieces can move in all 8 directions (horizontal, vertical, and diagonal).
- Most pieces can move up to 9 spaces in a single direction in one turn.  The _Militant_ can only move up to 2 spaces per turn.
